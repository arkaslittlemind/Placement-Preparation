Given a set of n distinct points on the x-axis, choose k of them such that the minimum distance between any two chosen points is as large as possible. Find this maximum possible minimum distance.

Example
Consider n = 5, k = 3 and x = [1, 4, 2, 9, 8]

The optimal solution, one of the possible selection of points is [1, 4, 8]. Here,

The distance between 1 and 4 = abs(1 - 4) = 3
The distance between 1 and 8 = abs(1 - 8) = 7
The distance between 4 and 8 = abs(4 - 8) = 4

The minimum among them is 3, which is the maximum possible.

Function description:
maximizeMinimumDistance has the following parameters:
int x[n]: the x-coordinate of points
int k: the number of points to choose

Returns:
int: the maximum possible minimum distance between any 2 of the chosen points.
